# feedsfeed

Combine multiple RSS feeds into one

## Installation

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/gitbootstrap/feedsfeed`
2. Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) dependencies `composer install`
3. Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) dependencies `npm install`
4. Run build task `gulp make`

## Configuration

All settings can be made inside `config.php`

## feeds.json

By default, the feeds are loaded from `feeds.json` (name and location can be modified). Here's a look at what this file can look like.

```json
[  
  {  
    "name":    "Bootstrap",
    "website": "https://getbootstrap.com",
    "channel": {
      "commits":  "https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/master.atom",
      "releases": "https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases.atom"
    }
  },
  {  
    "name":    "Font Awesome",
    "website": "http://fontawesome.io"
    "channel": {
      "commits": "https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/commits/master.atom",
      "releases": "https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases.atom"
    }
  },
]
```

The important key is `channel`, which can contain any number of sub-keys. The default channel is defined in `config.php`.
